## What is Khan?

Khan is an infrastructure management and provisioning tool.

It takes key ideas from Netflix's [Asgard](https://github.com/Netflix/asgard)
and my own experiences developing and managing applications using more traditional tools such
as Chef, Puppet, and Ansible on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

The key tenants behind Khan's approach to management and deployment of cloud applications
are convention-over-configuration, immutablity, and simplicity.
